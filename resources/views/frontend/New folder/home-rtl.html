<!--
        Set the website's favicon and Apple touch icon using the files in the assets/logo folder. You can change these files to your own icons by replacing them with the same names and sizes.

        Be careful if you change the site.webmanifest file, as you need to update the src attribute of the icons array to match the new path of your icon files. Otherwise, your icons may not display correctly on some devices.
